# State of the codebase

**Glove** in present from, originates from an unconventional method of creating web experiences that don't lie and cheat their receiver.

It is being driven by an early engineering M.O., which is backed by [first principles defined here](https://mirror.xyz/0x04F264eCb7ea1411726236675E88F04DC6421164/Wve-yAWeLcEhhOG_Rxgu6HWe0z7CAQXmaQjjxYtPRhY). Most of the work on codebase predates both, and was carried out intermittently through 2021, to derive measures from on-chain data that are not conveniently, freely, and openly available.

[Must Read the M.O.](https://mirror.xyz/0x04F264eCb7ea1411726236675E88F04DC6421164/jhpNPrj0dwT_5YC1u25sigwrXXOcgYVbe5Xld8B5tPs)

**Almost everything that makes up the ultimate minimal experience is yet to be implemented.** Changes should roll out eventually as more content is created to support specifications.

# Help yourself

Even though glove hosts a mirror on centralized TLD at [app.glove.fyi](https://app.glove.fyi) for people of the past, glovers are a force driving you to help yourself for your information! Here's how:

```bash
echo 'the world is tearing itself apart, survival is in the terminal'
echo 'start by installing git and node yourself, use nvm!'

# baby glover succeeds in running `node -v` "\^_^/"

git clone git@github.com:GloveFYI/glove.git --depth=1

cd glove && yarn

echo 'wait a millisecond'

yarn dev

```

Open the `localhost` link in browser and pin the tab.

Once in a while, run `git pull` and rerun `yarn dev`.

# Contribution

Glove competes with the status-quo, it breathes "yes can do". Competition goes fast, unnatural it is, friction there is, bright it burns. Time is mortal, the quicker ones wither sooner and die.

**Purposed open software outlives a generation:** delegate adaptability to userland, to realize a p2p-embedded experience, that self-contructs.

- what can be decoupled from core codebase, should be

- invest effort in standardization and data linking

- there is a future of data bridges flying in the decentralized web, simulate them

We keep up with realities, yet build away, bury the head time to time... balance is key.

If you, by an off-chance wish to contribute today, know that glove is running on rags, there is no money nor fame in it, no community, no use yet, "learning" is to your will, there's no one to promise it. If you are insane, you can volunteer for potential or open tasks. Otherwise, you can apply your interest to consider [covering for material resource needs](https://glove.fyi/manifest/).

# Concepts

## Denominated accounting

Glove POV: Chains are a classification to an asset, not something that chains it down, this will allow all engineering to adapt to maximal transaction analysis ex: stuff bridging around, delayed finality, innovations of future, unborn standards.

### metadata:: essential classifications

- fiat pegged assets and wrappers (usd, tusd, usdc)
- fiat derivative assets (non 1-to-1 stables, algos etc)
- network tokens and wrappers (eth, weth, tbtc, wbtc)
- non-denominated tokens (untradeable, illiquid, stakes etc)
